# Course: Vue Mastery Nuxt 3 Fullstack

This project contains the complete code for the following [course](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/nuxt-3-server).

In this course, Nuxt is used as a fullstack framework, taking advantage of its built-in backend capabilities. The purpose of this course is therefore to focus on server-side Nuxt middleware and routes for implementing a simple pokemon API, which in turns fetches data through an external API service.
